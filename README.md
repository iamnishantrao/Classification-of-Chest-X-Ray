# Classification of Chest X-Ray

Chest X-rays are amongst the most frequently used medical tests and play a crucial role in detecting lung-related medical issues. The interpretation of these images is time consuming and requires experts such as trained radiologists. It is possible to create machine learning algorithms to automate the process of image analysis and diagnosis with high efficiency and accuracy for a few specific use-cases. In this project, the objective is to analyze chest x-ray imaging data and diagnose patients for pneumonia or clear lungs.
